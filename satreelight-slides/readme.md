# SaTreeLight presentation

To edit the presentation, install the extension vscode-reveal in VS Code. Then open the [presentation.md](presentation.md) file. The presentation is made with reveal.js that exports from markdown to html.
Open the VS Code Reveal pane in the toolbar to launch/export the presentation to view it, or open the [index.html](export/index.html) in the [export](export) folder. Copy everything in the [export](export) folder to bring it around.
